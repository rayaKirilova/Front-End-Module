    <p>An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and
        are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild
        ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.</p>
    <p>Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European
        colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and
        European Christian tradition.</p>
    <p>Apple trees are large if grown from seed. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by grafting onto rootstocks,
        which control the size of the resulting tree.</p>
