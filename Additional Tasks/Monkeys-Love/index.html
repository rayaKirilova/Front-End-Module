                <p>We hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil. Everything we do is with and for love: love of our
                    friends from around the world and the new friends we will meet in the university. We are a playful
                    camp. We want to share great code with everyone who might journey to our desert jungle, and
                    hopefully climb up our monkey trees to enjoy a banana.</p>
